# NYC Citi Bike Analysis 

## Overview 
A trip to New York City has inspired me to start a bikesharing service at home in Des Moines, Iowa. This analysis has been created to provide data about the New York Citi Bike business model to a potential angel investor. 

## Results
After analyzing the NYC Citi Bike bikesharing data, we produced the below findings.

A total of 2,344,224 NYC Citi Bike trips were used to create the analysis. Out of these, 25.10% were female riders and 65.28% male riders. 
18.93% of the riders were customers and 81.07% of the riders are subscribers.

We can see that the highest amount of trips (145,147) had a duration of 5 minutes. Of these, 108,000 trips were made by males.

We can seet that the busiest times are weekdays between 6:00AM - 9:00AM and 4:00PM - 8:00 PM. Males predominantely rented the citi bikes during these hours.

Overall, NYC Citi Bikes are predominantly  ridden by subscriber males. 

Two additional visualizations I would use in my analysis would be a visual of the monthly revenue of the bikesharing service in NYC, and the demographics of the potential Des Moines users.
